# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).


Notes:

I've finished this tutorial now and done the majority of the exercises.
I may do the extensions in future but right now I think I want to get
back to python development.
